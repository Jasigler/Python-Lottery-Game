# Python-Lottery-Game
A simple python script to demonstrate the futility of playing a lottery.

This script simulates a 'lottery' by generating an array of 5 random numbers between 1 and 75 (The 'winning number'). Then, the user defines the number of times to play the game ('tickets'). For each ticket, a similar array is generated and matched against the winning number. These wins are tallied and then presented to the user. Unlike a normal lottery, however, there is not necessarily a winning 'ticket'.
